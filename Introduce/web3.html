        <p>Python / Machine Learning / Database / MediaPipe / 
            <br><br>MediaPipe is a cross-platform machine learning framework developed by Google, designed for implementing features such as hand tracking, 
            face detection, and pose estimation. By utilizing MediaPipe with Python, developers can swiftly create machine learning-based applications that incorporate these functionalities.
            The development process involves reading images or video streams, applying MediaPipe's processing modules, and visualizing or further analyzing the results. When paired with Python, 
            developers can efficiently deploy pre-built models through its streamlined API and integrate with tools like OpenCV for data processing and visualization. 
            The versatility of Python facilitates the integration of MediaPipe with other tools, 
            allowing for data post-processing and the creation of interactive applications.</p>

        <p>Python / Pygame
            <br><br>Utilizing Python's Pygame library to design a classic aircraft shooting game. The objective is to provide players with an exhilarating air combat experience while enabling developers to learn the fundamental technologies and design processes involved in game development. The game design includes the player controlling an aircraft to move through keyboard operations, avoiding rocks and shooting rocks to gain points. The game implementation is divided into multiple functional modules: first, use Pygame's graphics function to design dynamic backgrounds, airplanes, stones and bullets, simulating real flight scenes; secondly, realize the movement control of the player's airplane, random generation and movement path of stones, As well as the collision judgment of the player's bullet firing mechanism and the rocks; in addition, combining the score system and the health value mechanism, the rocks collision penalties and destruction rewards are designed, and explosion special effects and sound effects are added to the game to enhance the immersion. This topic also includes dynamic adjustments to the game logic, which will increase the difficulty of the game over time, allowing players to continue to feel a sense of challenge and achievement. Through this topic, developers will fully master the core game development skills such as event driving, collision detection, and game logic design, and can further expand functions on this basis.

        <p>HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Real-Time Exchange rate API <br><br>
            Using HTML in conjunction with a real-time exchange rate API as the foundation, develop an intuitive and practical currency query and conversion application. By leveraging the ExchangeRate-API, 
            implement real-time exchange rate updates and conversion functions for multiple currencies, enabling users to quickly access accurate exchange rate information. The implementation of the project is divided into three main components: page structure design, data interaction, and functionality expansion. First, use HTML to create the basic structure of the page, incorporating simple and intuitive input fields, a dropdown menu for selecting currencies, and a results display area. Enhance the page's aesthetic appeal with CSS to ensure a user-friendly experience and an attractive interface. Secondly, JavaScript plays a crucial role in this project, handling requests to the API and processing the returned JSON data. After the user inputs an amount and selects a currency, the system promptly requests the latest data from the exchange rate API, performs the necessary calculations, and updates the results area to provide immediate feedback.</p>

        <P>C++ / Arduino <br><br>
            Using Arduino, design an automated aquarium system that enables microcontroller-based temperature monitoring and regulation, ensuring the maintenance of the ideal water temperature in real-time. The core of the system consists of a water temperature sensor, such as the DS18B20, which continuously monitors the water temperature and transmits the data to the Arduino. When the temperature falls below a predetermined threshold, the system activates a heater to raise the water temperature. Conversely, if the temperature exceeds the desired level, the system employs a fan or other cooling devices to lower the temperature. The entire system is designed for automatic control and can be implemented with a simple circuit. This design creates a stable aquatic environment, making it suitable for breeding tropical fish and other aquatic organisms that require consistent water temperatures. Furthermore, the integration of LED indicators for alarm functions enhances the automation and intelligence of the aquarium.</P>

        Due to the rapid advancement of communication technology in recent years, communication-related products have become an indispensable part of people's lives. Among the various communication systems, RF passive components are widely utilized. For instance, in smartphones, passive circuits and components account for over 30% of the device, with filters and antennas being particularly crucial. To address the diverse needs of different communication system applications, a variety of RF components have been extensively employed in wireless communication systems. These components include filters, antennas, attenuators, phase shifters, mixers, and others, all of which are essential in high-frequency circuits. This report aims to propose a low-pass filter designed to eliminate aliasing effects in circuits, thereby ensuring stable circuit operation. Furthermore, low-pass filters are cost-effective, making them user-friendly.</p>
